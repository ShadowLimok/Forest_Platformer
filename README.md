## **Description:**

A shadow has fallen over the world of dense forests — a relentless blight consuming everything in its path, a curse forcing the inhabitants of towering trees to abandon their homes and flee in search of shelter. The forest awakens its child — the last hope, sent on a journey to the mysterious source of the disease, to stop it once and for all.
